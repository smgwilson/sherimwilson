        <h2><a name="about">About Me</a></h2>
            <div>
                <p>I’m an East coast transplant who moved to the Bay in 2014 with my overweight Balinese cat. My lifestyle here is focused on lake walks, urban hikes, food and wine, tech meetups, and finding the ideal coffee shop to park in for a while with my Mac.
                </p>  

                 <p>I’ve been using HTML since before “align” was a deprecated attribute, and building serious applications for over 7 years in a variety of languages. I’ve worked across the full stack, but have been focused most recently on front-end.  This site is the result of me reading somewhere that if you’re a front-end developer, you should have a personal website.  I don’t even recall where I read it, but I immediately thought, “Gotta do that!”
                 </p>

                <p>Technology is endlessly interesting because it’s always evolving, and there are always new languages and frameworks coming along.  Nowadays, my favorites to work with are ReactJs and Ruby on Rails (subject to change).  While there is no “one-size-fits-all” technical solution to every problem, I derive great satisfaction from figuring out what will work, and it makes my day to hear that something I developed has solved a need or made life easier for someone.  If there is something you’d like me to bounce off me or share, <a href="mailto:sheri@sherimwilson.com">please reach out!</a>
